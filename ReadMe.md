# About Project

Our marketplace tackles food waste through an innovative platform connecting retailers with products past their Sell By date to buyers at reduced prices. Leveraging the power of technology and the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, we built a high-performance web application with a robust architecture to support these goals. The platform serves as a solution to the prevalent issue of food waste by providing a streamlined process for retailers to list their surplus food items. Retailers can easily input details such as Sell By dates, product descriptions, and discounted prices. Through automated safety checks based on industry standards, we ensure that only safe-to-consume food items are made available to buyers. For buyers, our platform offers the opportunity to access quality food products at lower prices. They can browse through a wide range of available items, search by category, and set up personalized alerts for specific products. Purchasing these surplus food items not only saves money but also actively contributes to reducing food waste. Beyond connecting retailers and buyers, our platform facilitates the donation of surplus food items to charity and food pantries. Retailers have the option to allocate a portion of their surplus inventory for donation. Coordinating pickups and deliveries, our platform ensures that the donated food reaches those in need efficiently.

# Motivation
Food waste stands as an immense global predicament, entailing far-reaching ramifications. In accordance with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, a staggering one-third of all food produced for human consumption succumbs to wastage on an annual basis. This distressing statistic not only entails an alarming depletion of precious resources but also contributes substantially to the degradation of our environment, amplified greenhouse gas emissions, and exacerbates the prevailing specter of food insecurity.

Moreover, our groundbreaking platform transcends the mere realms of waste reduction, seamlessly integrating a commendable social cause aspect into its very fabric. Empowering retailers with the option to graciously donate their surplus products to charitable organizations and food pantries, we aspire to forge a united front against the rampant specter of hunger and destitution, extending a helping hand to the vulnerable communities that yearn for sustenance. By cultivating a more sustainable and compassionate food system, our initiative not only fosters a profound sense of communal responsibility but also serves as a catalyst, fostering invaluable collaboration between conscientious businesses and the noble organizations that champion the cause of eradicating hunger and hardship from our midst.
